# FAA Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA) Charts as KML Files

This repository contains a copy of the Minimum Vectoring Altitude
(MVA) charts from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the
original XML format.

An automatically generated KML copy of each chart is also provided,
together with the script used for their conversion.

Content:

* The original XML files from the FAA are in the `faa-xml` directory,
  as downloaded from the [official
  website](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/mva_mia/mva/).

* The converted KML files are in the `kml` directory; all charts are
  available independently, and are named after the original XML file.

* Foreflight content packs are in the `contentpack` directory. Each
  content pack includes all charts from the same ATC TRACON facility,
  and their name includes the three-char identifier of each
  facility. You can lookup the TRACON identifiers at [this
  link](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/air_traffic_services/tracon/).
